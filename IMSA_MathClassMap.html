The integers are defined axiomatically, and familiar properties of arithmetic are proven. Exploration then turns to divisibility, primes, the Fundamental Theorem of
Arithmetic, the GCD, linear diophantine equations, and multiplicative functions. Linear congruence problems and multiple congruences (Chinese Remainder Theorem) are followed by special congruences (Theorems of Wilson and Euler-Fermat). This is then used to
study decimal expansions of rational and real numbers. Further topics may include primality testing, continued fractions, introductory
cryptography, and quadratic reciprocity. This course is centered around a dual emphasis on calculation techniques and rigorous proof.
